# About this Project
While making a 2D map of Meteorite landings over at https://github.com/Camru/Meteorite-Landings,
I had been experimenting with Three.js and had the idea of visualizing the meteorites
hitting a 3D globe over time. I also came across the really cool project created
by the Google Data Arts Team, [WebGL Globe](https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe), which
allows you to superimpose datasets onto a 3D globe, and it inspired me to make my own.
I thought the meteorites dataset would be a perfect candidate for visualization.

# To make this project your own:
1. git clone https://github.com/Camru/Meteorite-Globe.git
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. navigate to http://localhost:3000/
